Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career).

I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.",minimum

"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",mild

She's well-connected at my workplace, so gets lots of support from her ""friends"" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her ""version"" of situations.

I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",moderate

Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder.",minimum

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",minimum

She even met with her ex after 3 months apart, confessing she misses him and cried. Since then things between them got complicated.",minimum

She knows I'm sexually active and I don't have a boyfriend and is really judgmental about me having casual sex. I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life. When I was younger, she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done, and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt. Whenever we argue she makes it a time to critique my entire personality and not just my behavior in that argument or even within my relationship with her.",severe

He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes, receiving a cute text from him, and ever since being in a relationship with him I’ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life. But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past, or he‘s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts, also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem. All of this really took a toll of our relationship, to the point that we hardly called anymore or had any communication.",minimum

If you have seen the film, people claim that where Tim Robbins character's faith went to was bound to happen because of his childhood assault.

After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going.

"Spring 2102 I began to see a man that I worked with and that only made my roommate jealous and angry. I went to a pdoc (who was basically a pharmaceutical dispensary and appointments only lasted 15 minutes) who diagnosed me with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and caffeine dependency. My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him. Late summer 2012 I was able to catch him doing a series of illegal things, had him arrested for petty theft and evicted him from the apartment. I spent a couple months more in the apartment and ultimately ended up moving in with the man I had begun to see (he and I have now been together almost 5 years).",minimum
"I’m a previous victim of abuse at home and since moving to university (the abuse ended way before uni) I’ve experienced very frequent nightmares both relating to and completely unrelated to my previous problems. It’s hard for me to go more than 3 nights without having at least a couple of nightmares a night, most of which relating to my trauma. Has anyone else experienced this?

"I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company.,minimum

All I keep hearing is to: go talk to doctors if I’m ill and get antidepressants if I’m depressed. Not realising that neither one will solve my problem. So I thought that maybe someone could help me out with this, maybe someone has similar experience.",minimum
"It was one week before the start of my second year of my bachelor’s degree. The first year was wonderful. The second, I was dead because of him… That night, we (my best friend (J), her boyfriend, and L) went to a party at N’s. I don’t really like to drink, so I stayed clear the whole time.",minimum
"I’m onto new studies now, erasing my ancient life, my life related to him. That’s how i’m reconstruct myself for now.

"Hi everyone, also posted on r/rapecounseling. Sorry for my english, it’s not my mother tongue. Past few months were pretty rough and I think i’m finally ready to write it down, like if I needed it… I was raped by a “friend” (let’s call him L), the exact day I met my actual boyfriend (let’s call him N), 5 years ago. L wasn’t really a friend of mine, I never appreciated him, but he was closely related to my best friend at the time.",minimum
"I remember thinking “What the hell is he doing ?!”. This guy was so tall, so much heavier than me… He grabbed me, was on top of me, told me to “shut my fucking mouth right now”. I tried so hard to move, but I couldn’t… I remember him spitting on his dick, and then he penetrated me, his hand over my mouth. It was so violent, so painful. I can still feel the sweat on his cheek...",minimum
"I do feel like some of my trust has been broken. I know he will always prefer to befriend girls, and I'm not the jealous type, but I just need some help with how to respond to him and how to process this whole scenario. What is the best way to process ""emotional"" cheating from the past?   ---   **tl;dr**: My (33F) husband [33M] of 10 years had private chat giving each other sexual advice with female friend/ childhood friend and hid it from me for 2 years.",minimum
"Save yourselves, and get a doggo if you can. *Make sure you have the financial stability, and get a dog that’s on-par with your dog experience. It’s important to remember they are a ton of work, large puppies especially, but the distraction is part of what helps. A lot of people get large, active, intelligent dogs as puppies and don’t understand they are a full-time job. For the protection of the dogs, if you’re a first time owner don’t get one that weighs over 30lbs when mature.",minimum
"I'm in my last year of my secondary school and we just had our mocks but that doesn't mean you can ease off the gas. I'm constantly rushing about trying to complete coursework by Christmas trying to revise feeling like I'm not putting enough effort in. my room is a tip and every time I try to fully clean it, it's completely wrecked a week later, I eat all my meals whilst revising (in my room) and the only social contact I have is at school I feel like I'm going crazy time is just passing me by and I'm not catching up i'm crying all the time and my health is just gone I'm getting cold after cold and fever after fever. I have no motivation to do anything I only revise because its all I can do. no amount of baths or trying to tidy my room helps what do I do?",minimum
"The knowledge that a small part somewhere inside my dad was ...my dad. He was never able to defeat his demons. They destroyed his life and started waging battles in mine.

day. It is getting on my nerves that she thinks that I am still the 12 year old boy who doesn't know about life. I got trouble to fall asleep since some time and if she is here I wake up between 6-8am after I fall asleep at 2-3am because of noise she make in bath or kitchen. One time she came here without telling me and I had to cancel my plans with my girlfriend which made both of us really angry. She even interfere how I painted my room after 10+ years looking like shit even if she doesn't live here anymore.,minimum
"However, I've vaguely brought it up before and she said that she wants to also invest one day. My gut feeling is that she's comfortable if we both pay rent and lose money, but might feel weird if one person is benefitting and the other person is not. Unfortunately, I'm 99% sure on my stance that I will either live at home or move out when I can invest in my own place, and I'm not sure how to tell her.   ---   **tl;dr**: Friend wants to rent an apartment together, but I'm getting cold feet.",minimum
"I've Shazamed it, I googled it. When I had a podcast, I even asked my listeners if any of them could tell me any information about it. Nothing. So now I'm hoping someone out there knows anything about the band, the song title ( my guess is that it's called ""The Bus"") The song is <url>",minimum
FOR ANYONE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION For anyone who wanted to know the name of Robin McGraw's (Dr. Phil's wife) domestic violence app. The app is Aspire.

"Ok, I don't normally post much and wasn't sure where exactly to post this. I am also not trying to brag or stroke my ego. I have an honest question. So, here is what happened.

"I'm not massively worried about it at the moment because it feels good but my question is: Is this a normal symptom of PTSD and if it continues tomorrow, should I call 111 for medical advice?

"My daughter's father I was with for 5 years on and off. He was not abusive the first year, however when he became so I left and found out two weeks later I was pregnant. Of course he begged and pleaded for a second chance, and I believed that my daughter deserved me to at least give it a shot. I came back and surprise surprise it was worse than it ever was. I stuck it out until he disappeared for the eleventeenth time on a drunken bender, I checked my Facebook to find some scumbag girl who was dating one of his best friends was posting horrific, nasty, way out shit about me.",minimum
"I cannot remember for a fact what age we were and for exactly how long the abuse occurred. But of course I can say for sure there is a 5-year age gap between us, me being younger and female. For some reason the age 8 keeps popping into my head as to how old I was when it happened. I may have been a tiny bit older, but I don't think much younger. I know for sure it happened on more than one occasion (so I don't believe this was experimental / curiosity adolescent sexual play).",minimum
"My other brother is quite religious / catholic - not sure how this will impact how he reacts when he finds out. Also, my husband now finds it very very hard to be around my brother when my mom and him and his gf get together for family occasions. I don't find it totally difficult, because he's always been in my life and I've gotten so used to just burying it and forgetting about the abuse. But my husband, understandably, has a different perspective. He tries to stay ""strong"" and act as ""normal"" as possible when we get together so that no one thinks anything is ""wrong"" or asks / puts us on the spot.",minimum
"I had been searching for a new place to live since the start of that 6 month notice but I was not capable of finding anywhere to go mainly due to not being able to afford any additional expenses nor was there any source for me to receive the money I required, and since then I have been living outside for the past 5 weeks. During my stay outdoors, I currently work and maintain 3 jobs; one that pays me officially and 'on the books', while the other two serve as jobs that pay me on the side and 'off the books'. This isn't an easy affair either as they all require me to travel to different locations around the area by walking or use of public transportation, which is one of the expenses I am forced to cover on my own and my lack of sleep does not help matters regarding my performance as these jobs. Currently, and for the past 5 weeks, I've been staying at the beach nearby my old home as this is the only area where I am not told to leave by any authority figures, such as on-site workers and police patrolling the area, and also the only area I felt remotely safe at. Recently the weather has gotten pretty bad and this place is no longer the safe haven it once was for me.",minimum

"Furthermore, I told him before we got really serious that I have anxiety and depression, and if he can’t handle that then I’ll understand if we end things. But *he* chose to stay with me and help me if I wanted it. Honestly I’m just tired of defending myself to him after this fight. I shouldn’t have to.
